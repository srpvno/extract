# extract
Basic python script to extract data using XPath as the main handler. It works for basic html tables. You can choose to remove the 
CSRFToken variable for simplicity. It is only added there because I required it to get through a login page on a prior example 
which require the cert key to pass through before I could scrape off any data. In case you couldn't tell, I was trying to grab
the names and phone numbers associated with the names.
